                        Obviously, you are expected to pay for your own Transportation costs, and for food and amenities once you check in. Resorts in places like Las Vegas, Hawaii, Miami and Mexico may have additional &quot;Resort Fees&quot; due at Check In to cover amenities like Wi-Fi, parking,and phone services, but they will disclose these to you at the time of booking. 95% of other destinations do not have such fees.

                        There are some other minor restrictions on using these Certificates, such as limit of One Per Family, minimum Age Requirements, you can not Sell them, and you may not live within 100 Miles of the Destination which you select. <br/>‚Äç<br/>Bookings are dependent upon Availability. Your activation fees are not refundable - given that you have 18 months in which to find available dates, and the availability often changes within a day or two, so don&#x27;t give up if the first time you call, you don&#x27;t get the exact dates that you want.
